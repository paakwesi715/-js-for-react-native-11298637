In this code, the formatArrayStrings function takes two arrays as arguments: an array
of strings (strings) and an array of numbers processed by the processArray function (numbers). 
It creates a new array called modifiedStrings to store the modified strings
based on the corresponding numbers. It iterates over each string in the strings array
and checks the corresponding number in the numbers array. If the number is even, it
converts the string to uppercase using the toUpperCase method. If the number is odd,
it converts the string to lowercase using the toLowerCase method. The modified strings 
are then added to the modifiedStrings array and returned.

The createUserProfiles function in the userInfo.js file takes an array of names and the
array of modified names from Task 2 as arguments (names and modifiedNames). It creates a
new array called userProfiles to store the user profile objects. It iterates over each 
name in the names array and creates a user profile object with the original name, modified 
name, and an auto-incremented ID starting from 1. The user profile objects are then added 
to the userProfiles array and returned.
